I am a PhD Candidate (ABD) at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA, specializing in advanced data analytics for the planning, management, and performance improvement of civil infrastructure projects. My doctoral research, supervised by [Dr. Chau Le](https://et.charlotte.edu/people/chau-le/), [Dr. Jake Smithwick](https://et.charlotte.edu/directory/jake-smithwick-phd-mpa/), [Dr. Harun Pirim](https://www.ndsu.edu/people/harun-pirim), and [Dr. Jay Wu](https://cee.charlotte.edu/directory/jy-s-wu-phd-pe-ph/) focuses on data-driven methodologies to enhance infrastructure project delivery and performance. My research has been published in peer-reviewed top journals of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Additionally, I hold a Master's degree in Construction Management and a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. My professional experience includes project management, scheduling and controls, construction safety, and risk assessment.
